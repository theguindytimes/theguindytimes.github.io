As, youngsters, a lot of our ideas, political or otherwise, are brushed off as rebelliousness. What would you&nbsp;tell&nbsp;them about tackling such a situation?</em></span><img alt="" src="/ckeditor_assets/pictures/321/content_bedi2.jpg" style="border-style:solid; border-width:3px; float:right; height:267px; margin:10px; width:400px" /></span></span></span></p>

Policing is the power to change. But the problem is that when you are in power, you stop changing. Power is the duty to reform. You are not yet in power. This phase is a training for you. If you as students and the youth, have already started making the change or want to make a change, use your persuasive power, social power and the power of&nbsp;perseverance because you don&rsquo;t have the legal power yet. This will one day let you use this power for the right change. So you are not a rebel. You are driving a change based on ethics and as&nbsp;long as it is ethical, you do it for the larger good whether others like it&nbsp;or not.&rdquo;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color:transparent"><strong>GT:</strong> <em>You and your&nbsp;Non-profit Organisations focus a lot on women&nbsp;empowerment apart from many other initiatives, but do you think it is easy for a&nbsp;woman to balance work and family? Or is it just a&nbsp;myth that it is&nbsp;tough?</em></span></span></span></span><br />
<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color:transparent"><strong>Dr.Kiran Bedi:</strong> &ldquo;I focus on community development. Every person needs their own type of&nbsp;empowerment, whether it is women,&nbsp;children or the elderly. So unless you empower the community, you cannot empower a single segment of the society. And about balancing, it is about using your time. If you are a good manager, surround yourself with a good support system, and you do what you are best and delegate the rest, it makes you a good leader and that can be applied to your personal life as well.&rdquo;</span><br />
<br />
<em><span style="background-color:transparent"><strong>GT:</strong> Why did women have reservations about joining the IPS back then? Was it because of the obstacles they would face? And how&nbsp;did you handle your challenges?&quot;</span></em></span></span></span><br />
<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color:transparent"><strong>Dr.Kiran Bedi:</strong> &ldquo;There were no obstacles for women as such to be in the IPS. It is just about being&nbsp;determined and wanting to be there. I was&nbsp;quizzed if I was serious about taking this up, and if you are determined it won&rsquo;t be tough. I was never forced to join the services, and my upbringing was such that it was almost a natural&nbsp;orientation. And for me there weren&rsquo;t any&nbsp;challenges or obstacles I faced being a woman, because I was always an outdoor girl. I was a tennis player from a very young age, and I was in uniform from 14 because I was a part of the NCC. So it&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t new.&rdquo;</span><br />

<em><span style="background-color:transparent"><strong>GT:</strong> In conclusion, what would be one piece of advice you&rsquo;d give to the Gen-Y?</span></em></span></span></span><br />
