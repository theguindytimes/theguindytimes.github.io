The plus initiative aims to reach out to people in need and to add smiles to their faces. It is a platform for conducting social events which acts as a tool for helping the under privileged. The main idea of the plus initiative is to exploit the &quot;Techofes&quot; brand, to create a social impact and convert it into a useful tool, which not only guarantees fun to college students but also has the power to change the lives of those in need.</span></span></span></p>

This includes the Becoming I Foundation, which is an internationally recognized youth led organization that mobilizes young people into engaging with community development issues.

<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The first event &quot;Secret Santa&quot; was launched yesterday in association with Ayamara. It offers a way for people to give gifts at low cost to economically weaker kids. The initiative is aimed at spreading joy and unconditional love to the underprivileged and the disadvantaged sections of the society in Chennai. Photos of various children from Aid India, a non-profit organization working on various development initiatives, have been put up in the Facebook page of Techofes + along with the gifts which they need. To contribute, comment on the picture of the kid for whom you&#39;d like to donate and thus be the Secret Santa for him/her. You, as the kids&#39; Secret Santa, can get them what they want or can help connect them with people who want to get them what they want for Christmas 2014. The items can be both used or new, but just make sure that it is usable and in good condition. This is a completely seamless measure which ensures that a student&#39;s pocket money itself is sufficient enough to support a good cause. There are around 27 volunteers involved with Ayamara out of which 25 members are from CEG. Once the gifts are ready, the volunteers plan to collect them and make sure it reaches the kids before Christmas, by the 23rd of December.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">There are numerous events lined up for registration. &quot;Dare to Care&quot; is an important event that is going to happen during Techofes, being organized by Dhakshina. Registrations are about to open this December 13th. The event focuses on five different themes like animal rehabilitation, helping the elderly and three others issues that are yet to be decided. Participants can be in teams and are expected to do at least one good deed based on the theme they are entrusted upon. Be it building a home for a stray pup or feeding a poor old man, this event primarily aims to develop the virtues of kindness, caring and generosity. Participants are supposed to take photos of the deeds they perform and hash tag them with Techofes +&#39;s official Facebook page, based on which they will be evaluated. SAAS has also planned a marathon and quite a few competitions based on social entrepreneurship. Usually, the festival brings together some of the talents in varied fields, from music, to drama and quizzing. This year it vows to bring out the social activism, through such events, in young minds.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

In addition, it will automatically leave a significant impact in the society about how we all, as college students, can contribute to the upliftment of underprivileged children&quot;</span></span></span><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">.
